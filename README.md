# GENZ-AI-SUPPORT-APP

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Set Up Environment Variables

To run the application, you need to set up a `.env.local` file with your OpenRouter key. Create the file at the root of your project and add the following line:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key-here
```

Replace `your-openrouter-key-here` with your actual OpenRouter API key.

### Run the Development Server

After setting up the environment variables, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
